# 2nd Project for the Machine Learning Topics class of 2023/2024

## Intel Image Classification

### Introduction

Image classification plays a pivotal role in various fields, from environmental monitoring to automated content tagging. In recent years, advancements in machine learning (ML) have led to remarkable improvements in image recognition systems, enabling accurate classification of complex visual data. This project focuses on leveraging ML techniques to classify different types of landscapes using the Intel Image Classification dataset. By training models to recognize and categorize landscape images, we aim to enhance our ability to analyze and interpret natural environments. Such models can be applied in fields like geographic information systems (GIS), environmental conservation, and automated tourism applications, fostering better understanding and management of diverse landscapes.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to build, train, and test a machine learning model using the "Intel Image Classification" dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains around 25,000 images, each with a resolution of 150x150 pixels, representing six distinct categories of landscapes. The images are labeled into the following classes: 'buildings' (0), 'forest' (1), 'glacier' (2), 'mountain' (3), 'sea' (4), and 'street' (5). The goal is to develop a model that accurately classifies these images into their respective categories.

### Conclusion

Several machine learning models were developed for the task, including techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks, AlexNet, MobileNetV2 and VGG16. Among these, the most successful in terms of accuracy was a VGG16, which achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 92.5%
